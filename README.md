## Future Plans
This project is in its early stages and serves as a way for me to explore and experiment. Possible future developments might include:
- Customizable templates.
- A simple command-line interface.

However, there are no guarantees or timelines for these updates, as this project is primarily for my own learning and enjoyment.

## Note
This project is a personal work in progress. It is not intended to be a production-ready tool. Use it at your own discretion.
