A minimal static site generator. This project is a personal educational exercise, designed to help me learn and improve my skills in C programming and software development.

## **Future Plans**
This project is in its early stages and serves as a way for me to explore and experiment. Possible future developments might include:
- Full Markdown parsing.
- Customizable templates.
- A simple command-line interface.

However, there are no guarantees or timelines for these updates, as this project is primarily for my own learning and enjoyment.

## **Note**
This project is a personal work in progress. It is not intended to be a production-ready tool or a tutorial for others, but rather a way for me to practice and improve my programming skills. Use it at your own discretion!
